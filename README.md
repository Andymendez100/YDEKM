## **For those that would like to Build upon the game.**

Firstly make a seprerate branch for yourself off the master branch. Then you will have to install that branch to your computer. We are using yarn instead of npm so if you npm install that could turn into errors in the future. So after you have installed the branch you will have to download the current dependancies as well. So make your way to the github folder on your computer using a type of unix based terminal, for example Git Bash/Linux/Mac terminal. From there you will use the yarn install command to download the dependencies for the project. Now it is time to start coding!!!

## **Objective of the game**

The objective of the game is to see if you know the other player as well as you think you do.

## **Guide for the game**

The purpose of the game KnowMe is to see how well the players know each other.

This is a 2 player game so one of the players will first have to create a lobby by choosing which quiz they would like to play.

Once a quiz has been selected PLAYER 2 will then navigate to the join lobby page and join PLAYER 1's lobby
Now both players will answer the questions given to them.

To make the game easier for the other player please try to keep the answer to a single word that comes to mind.

After both players have answered their questions they will then have to answer what the other player would answer for that question.

Once you have finished it is now time to see how well you know the other player.

For each answer you have answered correctly you will get a point and whoever has the most points WINS.

Lastly have fun and dont stress out. If you didnt know the answer to a question before now you know.
