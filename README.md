## **For those that would like to Build upon the game.**

Firstly make a seprerate branch for yourself off the master branch. Then you will have to install that branch to your computer. We are using yarn instead of npm so if you npm install that could turn into errors in the future. So after you have installed the branch you will have to download the current dependancies as well. So make your way to the github folder on your computer using a type of unix based terminal, for example Git Bash/Linux/Mac terminal. From there you will use the yarn install command to download the dependencies for the project. Now it is time to start coding!!!

## **Objective of the game**
